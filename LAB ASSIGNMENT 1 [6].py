#QUESTION
'''
Explain each of the following
a. a/b
b. a%b
c. a//b
'''

#SOLUTION:
'''
a.  a/b:
    The ( / ) operator is called "Division" and is used for division. Ir basically divides first operand with the other.

b.  a%b:
    The ( % ) operator is called "Modulus" operator. It gives the remainder when first operand is divided b the other.

c.  a//b:
    The ( // ) operator is called "Floor Division" operator. It also divides first operand by the other but while giving remainder it only gives the integer value and the decimal part is ignored.
'''

#Examples:
#a. 

a = 20
b = 2
division = a/b
print(division)

#b.

a = 25
b = 2
modulus = a%b
print(a%b)

#c

a = 25
b = 2
floor_division = a//b
print(a//b)

#This is hoe the above ooperators are used.

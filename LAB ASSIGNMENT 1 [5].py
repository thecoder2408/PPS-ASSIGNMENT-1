#QUESTION:
#How to assign value to a variable? Give few examples of each data type.

#SOLUTION:
'''
We can assign any value to a variable using the operator ( = ).
For Example:
            A = 1
            B = 2.2
            my_name = ("ANAND ANIL DAREKAR")
            num = ("245624")
'''

#One more example using a programme:

a = 25
b = 25
addition = a+b
multi_num = a*b

print(addition)
print(multi_num)

#This is how we assign values to a variable.

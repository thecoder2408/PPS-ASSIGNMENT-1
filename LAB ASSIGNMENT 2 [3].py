#QUESTION
#Give difference between list and tuple. Explain using example.

#SOLUTION
'''
SR.NO.	 LIST	                                                                        |  TUPLE
1	      Lists are mutable	                                                           | Tuples are immutable
2	      Implication of iterations is Time-consuming	                                 |  The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
3	      The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.|	 Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
4	      Lists consume more memory	                                                   |  Tuple consume less memory as compared to the list
5	      Lists have several built-in methods	                                         |  Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
6	      The unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur	                  |  In tuple, it is hard to take place.
